# Age Detection on Static Image     

## Dataset  
Preprocessing on images already finished --resulting images saved in json as datframes  
-- Current linked dataset will not work (Images have been resized to save
improve total neurons)  
link will be included to google drive for new resized dataset (120 by 120)

## Testing different modeling  
Expected to get higher accuracy rates via using gpu enabled machine and by
adding pooling layers after the conv layers.
